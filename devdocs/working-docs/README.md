# Working Documents (GITIGNORED)

This folder is a **scratch space** for LLM coding assistants.

## Purpose

- Session notes and context tracking
- Investigation and debugging notes
- Draft documentation before promotion to technical-docs
- Temporary analysis and research
- Experimental ideas

## Rules

1. **This folder is gitignored** - nothing here persists to version control
2. **Can be nuked anytime** - don't put anything important here
3. **Promote good content** - if you write something valuable, move it to `technical-docs/`
4. **No secrets** - even though gitignored, don't store credentials or keys

## For Humans

Feel free to delete everything in this folder periodically. It's just LLM scratch work.

## Suggested File Patterns

- `session-YYYY-MM-DD.md` - Daily working notes
- `investigate-[topic].md` - Research on specific issues
- `draft-[doc-name].md` - Documents in progress
- `debug-[feature].md` - Debugging session notes
