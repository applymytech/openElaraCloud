This folder contains authoritative technical documentation for OpenElara Cloud development.

## Contents

## Document Guidelines

Each technical document should:

1. State its purpose clearly in the first paragraph
2. Include "Last Updated" dates for time-sensitive content
3. Reference actual code paths where relevant
4. Include working code examples, not pseudo-code
5. Note any prerequisites or dependencies

## For AI Coding Assistants

When modifying this codebase:
1. Check relevant technical docs first
2. Update docs when making architectural changes
3. Add new docs for significant new features
4. Keep examples in sync with actual code
