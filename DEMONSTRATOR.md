## What This Is

OpenElara Cloud is a **demonstration** of a sovereign cloud AI assistant architecture. It shows:

- ✅ BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) - Users control their own AI costs
- ✅ Firebase deployment - Scalable, serverless infrastructure
- ✅ Multi-turn reasoning (Deep Thought) - Agentic tool use
- ✅ Live web research (Exa.ai integration) - Real-time data
- ✅ Character-based interactions - Persona system
- ✅ Media generation - Images and videos
- ✅ Invite-only architecture - Privacy-focused

## What This Is NOT

❌ **NOT a finished commercial product**  
❌ **NOT intended to be "feature complete"**  
❌ **NOT providing customer support**  
❌ **NOT guaranteeing uptime or reliability**

## The Point of This Project

This code is **freely shared** by me (an individual developer) to demonstrate:

- How to build a sovereign AI assistant
- How to integrate modern AI APIs (Together.ai, OpenRouter, Exa)
- How to deploy on Firebase with security
- How to implement BYOK architecture
- How to build agentic tool-using AI systems

**You are ENCOURAGED to:**
- Take this code
- Modify it for your needs
- Deploy it yourself
- Build your business on it
- Share your improvements

## What Features Are Missing?

### Cloud vs Desktop

Some features are **desktop-only** by design:

| Feature | Cloud | Desktop |
|---------|-------|---------|
| Chat with AI | ✅ | ✅ |
| Image Generation | ✅ | ✅ |
| Video Generation | ✅ | ✅ |
| Deep Thought (agentic) | ✅ | ✅ |
| Web Search (Exa) | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Vision Models** | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Image Upload/Analysis** | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Code Studio** | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Local RAG** | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Piper TTS** | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Local AI Models** | ❌ | ✅ |

**Why?** 
- Vision features require complex file handling and storage
- Desktop app has better UI for advanced features
- Cloud version focuses on **simple, reliable chat + generation**

**Want vision support?** 
→ You have the code! Add it yourself! That's the point!

## Licensing Philosophy

### ✅ FREE Use Cases (No Permission Needed)

You can use OpenElara Cloud for **free** if you:

1. **Use it personally** - Deploy for yourself/friends/family
2. **Use it in your business** - Internal tools, employee assistants
3. **Give it away** - Deploy and share access for free
4. **Profit indirectly** - Make your business more efficient with Elara
5. **Modify and redistribute** - Fork, improve, share your version

### ⚠️ Permission Required

You **need permission** from me if you:

- **Charge people to access Elara** - SaaS model, subscription service, per-use fees

**Why this rule?**  
I want to encourage **business use** and **innovation**, but prevent someone from just taking my work and selling access without contributing back or partnering.

**How to get permission?**  
Contact me if you want to build a commercial SaaS. Let's talk! I'm reasonable.

## Philosophy: Sovereign AI

This project embodies **sovereignty**:

- **Your data** - You control where it goes
- **Your keys** - You pay AI providers directly (BYOK)
- **Your deployment** - You own the Firebase project
- **Your code** - Open source, modify as needed
- **Your rules** - Invite-only, your users, your policies

This is the **opposite** of vendor lock-in. You own everything.

## What If I Want More Features?

**Option 1: Use Desktop App**  
OpenElara Desktop has vision, Code Studio, local RAG, etc.

**Option 2: Code It Yourself**  
You have the code! Examples:
- Add vision models? Check desktop's vision handler
- Add image uploads? Check desktop's file handling
- Add RAG? Already partially there (Context Canvas)
- Add custom features? It's yours to modify!

**Option 3: Contribute Back**  
Made something cool? Share it! That's the spirit.

## Technical Support

This is a **demonstrator**, not a product. That means:

- ❌ No guaranteed support
- ❌ No SLA or uptime promises
- ❌ No customer service hotline
- ✅ Code is well-documented (read it!)
- ✅ Community can help each other
- ✅ Issues/discussions welcome (but not guaranteed)

## Deployment Recommendations

### For Learning/Testing
- Use the demo deployment (if I share one)
- Deploy your own on free Firebase tier
- Experiment, break things, learn

### For Production Use
- **Deploy your own instance** (you control it)
- Review security rules carefully
- Set up proper user management
- Monitor costs (BYOK helps!)
- Add features YOU need

## Final Words

This is not a product. This is a **gift** of knowledge and working code.

Take it. Break it. Fix it. Improve it. Deploy it. Profit from it.

Just don't charge people to access it without talking to me first.
