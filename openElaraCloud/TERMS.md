**OpenElara Cloud - Apply My Tech**  
**Last Updated:** January 7, 2026

---

## The Simple Version

Hi, I'm Andrew - a hobbyist developer. OpenElara Cloud is my vision of what a sovereign AI assistant could look like. It's a **demonstration and educational tool**, not a commercial product.

**The deal is simple:**
- ✅ Use it FREE for personal, educational, development, or business use
- ✅ Deploy it to YOUR Firebase project (BYOC)
- ✅ Modify it, learn from it, share it
- ❌ Don't sell it or build commercial products on top of it without talking to me
- ⚠️ You must be 18+ to use this application

---

## 1. What This Is

OpenElara Cloud is:
- 🎓 An **educational demonstration** of sovereign cloud AI architecture
- 🔬 A **proof of concept** for BYOK + BYOC patterns
- 🛠️ A **hobbyist project** that grew into something useful
- 💡 A **vision** of user-controlled, self-hosted AI

OpenElara Cloud is **NOT**:
- ❌ A polished commercial product
- ❌ A replacement for professional AI services
- ❌ Something with guaranteed uptime or support SLAs
- ❌ Backed by lawyers and investors

---

## 2. Age Requirement

**You must be 18 years or older to use OpenElara Cloud.**

This is non-negotiable. The application can connect to AI services that may generate mature content. It's not appropriate for minors.

By using OpenElara Cloud, you confirm you are at least 18 years of age.

## 3. License (What You Can Do)

**FREE for:**
- ✅ Personal use
- ✅ Education and learning
- ✅ Development and experimentation
- ✅ Internal business use
- ✅ Research
- ✅ Modifying the code
- ✅ Sharing with others

**Requires commercial license:**
- Building commercial products that incorporate OpenElara Cloud
- Selling OpenElara Cloud or derivative works
- Using OpenElara Cloud as the basis for a paid service

If you want to build a commercial product, email me: **openelara@applymytech.ai**

My philosophy: *1% of a million is better than 50% of nothing. I want you to succeed.*

## 4. BYOK + BYOC Model

### Bring Your Own Key (BYOK)

OpenElara Cloud requires users to provide their own API keys for AI services:

- **Users pay AI providers directly** (Together.ai, OpenAI, etc.)
- **Users are responsible for API costs**
- **Users must follow each provider's terms of service**
- **Apply My Tech has no access to user keys or conversations**

### Bring Your Own Cloud (BYOC)

OpenElara Cloud runs on YOUR Firebase project:

- **You deploy to YOUR infrastructure**
- **Your data lives in YOUR Firestore**
- **Your files go to YOUR Storage**
- **You control security, access, and retention**

We provide the code. You provide everything else.
