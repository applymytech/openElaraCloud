OpenElara Cloud License

## 🎁 A Gift to the World

OpenElara Cloud is my gift to you. I don't want your data. I don't want your money 
(unless you build a commercial product - then let's talk). 

There is no secret data mining. No telemetry. No hidden agenda. No "premium 
tier" coming later. Elara is yours - use her well.

## The Spirit of This License

Hi, I'm Andrew - a hobbyist developer with a dream. OpenElara Cloud is my vision 
of what a sovereign AI assistant could look like: running on YOUR Firebase 
infrastructure, calling AI services with YOUR keys, and putting YOU in control.

This isn't a commercial product. It's a **demonstration and educational tool**.
I built it to learn, to teach, and to show what's possible.

## What You Can Do (FREE)

You can use OpenElara Cloud completely FREE for:

✅ **Personal Use** - Chat with AI, generate images, explore AI capabilities
✅ **Education** - Learn about AI, study the code, teach others
✅ **Development** - Build your skills, experiment, prototype
✅ **Business** - Deploy it internally for your company
✅ **Research** - Study how sovereign AI assistants can work
✅ **Modify** - Change the code, add features, make it yours
✅ **Distribute** - Share it with friends, colleagues, students

## The Only Thing I Ask

If you build a **commercial product** that incorporates OpenElara Cloud's code or 
architecture - something you sell to customers or use as the basis for a paid 
service - then please reach out about a commercial license.

I'm not here to squeeze you. My philosophy is simple:
- **1% of a million is better than 50% of nothing**
- **I want you to succeed**
- **Don't worry about how much you pay me, just pay me something**

If you're making money FROM OpenElara (not just WITH it), let's talk. We'll work 
something out that's fair and doesn't kill your business.

## What This Is

OpenElara Cloud is:
- 🎓 An **educational demonstration** of sovereign cloud AI architecture
- 🔬 A **proof of concept** for BYOK + BYOC (Bring Your Own Key + Cloud)
- 🛠️ A **hobbyist project** that grew into something useful
- 💡 A **vision** of how AI could work: user-controlled, self-hosted

## BYOK + BYOC Philosophy

**Bring Your Own Key (BYOK):**
- You provide your own API keys (Together.ai, OpenRouter, OpenAI, etc.)
- You pay AI providers directly at their rates
- Your keys stay in YOUR browser - never on our servers

**Bring Your Own Cloud (BYOC):**
- You deploy to YOUR Firebase project
- Your data lives in YOUR Firestore
- Your files go to YOUR Firebase Storage
- You control everything

We don't charge for the app. We don't take a cut. It's your infrastructure.

## No Warranty

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR 
IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,

This is a hobbyist project. Things might break. I'll do my best to help, but 
there's no support hotline or guaranteed response time.

## Open Source Promise

Don't trust us? Good! OpenElara Cloud is open source so you can:
- Review all source code
- Verify our claims
- Build from source
- Fork and modify
